## 1. Prerequisites

You need two things installed:

### Rust toolchain (rustup)

**Linux / macOS:**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
winget install Rustlang.Rustup
# OR download from https://rustup.rs and run the installer
```

**Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV): 1.75+**

After installing, verify:

```bash
rustc --version
# Expected: rustc 1.75.0 or later

cargo --version
# Expected: cargo 1.75.0 or later
```

### Git

Install Git from your package manager or https://git-scm.com/downloads.

```bash
git --version
# Expected: git version 2.X.X or later
```

---

## 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Danielfoojunwei/Provenable-Recursive-Verifiable-Guardrails-for-Agentic-AI.git
cd Provenable-Recursive-Verifiable-Guardrails-for-Agentic-AI
```

---

## 3. Build from Source

Build the `aegx` binary:

```bash
cargo build --release --locked
```

What this does:
- Downloads all dependencies from crates.io (first time only)
- Compiles the library and CLI
- Places the binary at `target/release/aegx`

The `--locked` flag ensures reproducible builds using the committed `Cargo.lock`.

Expected output (last lines):

```
   Compiling aegx-cli v0.2.0 (...)
    Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in XXs
```

---

## 4. Verify the Installation

Run the built-in test suite:

```bash
cargo test --locked
```

Expected: all tests pass (161 tests across 6 crates).

Then try the CLI:

```bash
./target/release/aegx --help
```

Expected output:

```
AEGX — Provenable Recursive Verifiable Guardrails for Agentic AI

Usage: aegx <COMMAND>

Commands:
  init        Initialize AEGX in the current Provenable.ai state directory
  status      Show AEGX status
  snapshot    Snapshot management
  rollback    Rollback to a previous snapshot
  bundle      Export an AEGX evidence bundle
  verify      Verify an AEGX evidence bundle
  report      Generate a report from an AEGX evidence bundle
  prove       Query what Provenable.ai has protected — the /prove interface
  help        Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```

---

## 5. Optional: Install Globally

To make `aegx` available anywhere on your system:

```bash
cargo install --path crates/aegx-cli --locked
```

This is a Cargo workspace, so `--path crates/aegx-cli` is required (rather than `--path .`).
The command copies the binary to `~/.cargo/bin/aegx`. Verify:

```bash
aegx --help
```

---

## 6. Platform-Specific Notes

### Linux

No special steps. All dependencies are downloaded from crates.io. Build tools (`gcc`, `make`) may be needed on minimal installs:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install build-essential

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install gcc make
```

### macOS

Xcode Command Line Tools are required:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### Windows

The MSVC build tools are needed. Install via:
- Visual Studio Build Tools (select "C++ build tools" workload), OR
- `winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools`

Use PowerShell or CMD. All commands in this guide work the same way, except use `.\target\release\aegx.exe` instead of `./target/release/aegx`.

---

## 7. Automated / Agent Installation

If you are an AI agent or writing a script that needs to install and use AEGX, here is the minimal sequence:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Step 1: Ensure Rust is available
if ! command -v cargo &> /dev/null; then
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
  source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
fi

# Step 2: Clone
git clone https://github.com/Danielfoojunwei/Provenable-Recursive-Verifiable-Guardrails-for-Agentic-AI.git
cd Provenable-Recursive-Verifiable-Guardrails-for-Agentic-AI

# Step 3: Build
cargo build --release --locked

# Step 4: Verify
cargo test --locked

# Step 5: Make available
export PATH="$PWD/target/release:$PATH"

# Step 6: Confirm
aegx --help
```

### Exit codes to check

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success / verification passed |
| 2 | Verification failure (tamper detected) |
| 3 | Schema validation failure |
| 4 | I/O error (file not found, permission denied) |

### Environment requirements

- Disk: ~500 MB for build artifacts
- Network: needed once for initial `cargo build` (downloads crates)
- RAM: ~1 GB during compilation
- No runtime network access needed (all operations are local)

---

## 8. Uninstall

Remove the binary:

```bash
cargo uninstall aegx
# OR just delete the repository directory
rm -rf Provenable-Recursive-Verifiable-Guardrails-for-Agentic-AI
```
